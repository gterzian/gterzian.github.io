Xintiandi
=========

####High end shopping and living district not far from People's Square. The whiteboard is a list of advertised real estate prices. the 万 character stands for 10.000 so 1180万 is 111.800.000 RMB, about 18 million USD for 170m2. Consider the average salary in Shanghai is 800 USD. I think this is more expensive than NYC or SF.
