High-speed train travel in China
================================

####The high-speed trains in China are really quite amazing. The stations feel like the largest airports you've been to, and there is a train leaving or arriving every minute it seems, packed everytime! This is me going from Shanghai to Beijing to visit my friend Rui. If you go to Beijing, make sure to grab a nice fast-food style hot-pot at Xiabu Xiabu upon arrival!
