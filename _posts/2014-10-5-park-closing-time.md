Closing time
============

####Around 6PM the huge crowd showing up for the 'marriage market' at People's Square is 'disbanded' by the park guardians, the actual park stays open until much later actually. Guess if they wouldn't do this the people would continue trying to find a partner for their sons and daughters until falling down from exhaustment.
