The suburbs of Beijing
======================

####This town called [Yanjiao](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yanjiao) is actually not even part of Beijing, however it can be considered a suburb of it, as the sprawling city keeps strechting out into neighboring areas. These are the very typical Chinese newly built highrises, I stayed in one of them courtesy of my friend Rui.
