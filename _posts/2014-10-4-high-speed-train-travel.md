High-speed train travel in China
================================

####The high-speed trains in China are really quite amazing. The stations feel like the largest airports you've been to, and there is a train leaving or arriving every minute it seems, and it's packed everytime! This is me going from Shanghai to Beijing. If you go, make sure to grab a nice fast hot pot upon arrival!
