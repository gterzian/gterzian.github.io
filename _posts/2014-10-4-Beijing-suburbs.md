The suburbs of Beijing
======================

####This town called [Yanjiao](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yanjiao) is actually not even part of Beijing, however it can be considered a suburb of it, as the sprawling city keeps strechting out into neighboring areas. These are very typical Chinese newly built highrises, I stayed in one of them courtesy of my friend Rui. Everything is so brand new that the plastic cover is still on it. Actually the Chinese really like to keep the plastic cover on stuff as long as they can.
