Welcome to the Shanghai branch of the Bureau of Entry-Exit Administration
=========================================================================

####I arrived at 4PM, not knowing the whole thing closes at 4.30PM. If this happens to you, don't worry about the amount of people ahead of you, at 4.15PM the normal 'pick a number' approach is replaced by a guy shouting in a megaphone and telling people to line up at specific gates. All cases will have be dealt with by closing time. Interesting to note most people applying here are of Chinese descent and this is not the floor where people applying to exit the country.
