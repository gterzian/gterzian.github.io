The very busy Beijing Hou Hai on a Saturday
===========================================

####I enjoyed the [HouHai](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houhai) so much that I went back there on a saturday with my friend Linan, needless to say it turned out to be packed compared to the first time I went. Had a peek as some interesting Beijing street sports too. Lots of bars open up on the weekend.
